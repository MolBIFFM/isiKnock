In silico knockouts for signaling pathways

## Description

Signaling pathways are complex and intertwined processes. The perturbation of biological systems can reveal the complicated interplay and dependencies of pathway components. The computational analysis of knockout behavior is a valuable method to detect inconsistencies in the current knowledge of a pathway. Furthermore, in silico knockouts can confirm the structural topology of the computational model of a signaling pathway and predict unknown systems behavior to support experimental design.

isiKnock is a software to automatically conduct in silico knockouts for signaling pathways. Single as well as multiple knockouts can be performed. The results are visualized using a matrix representation. isiKnock predicts the knockout behavior based on the calculation of signal flows at steady state. For an explanation of the concept of in silico knockouts, we refer to Scheidel et al. 2016 and Amstein et al. 2017.
